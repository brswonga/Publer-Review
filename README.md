## Pricing Breakdown: Is Publer Worth It?

### Plans for All Sizes

Here’s how Publer’s pricing shapes up in 2025:

#### ✅ Free Plan  
Great for beginners or hobbyists. Manage up to 3 accounts, schedule 10 posts per profile, and get access to some limited premium features like Instagram’s Link in Bio.

#### 💼 Professional Plan – Starts at $12/month  
Designed for solo creators or marketers. Offers unlimited scheduling, content libraries, RSS posting, and access to Twitter features.

### Competitive Comparison

Compared to Hootsuite ($19+/month) or Buffer ($15+/month), Publer still holds its own with flexible pricing and rich features. However, recent price hikes mean smaller users might want to weigh their needs closely—or explore budget-friendly alternatives like Social Champ.

That said, if you're looking for serious automation and collaboration, Publer is still a solid choice.
